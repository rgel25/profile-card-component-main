## Welcome! üëã

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.
This is a simple web application showcasing my command of HTML and CSS.

## The challenge

This is a very basic challenge involving a card layout. The only unusual design choice here is the profile picture position being offset a little bit to the top.

## My solution

After building the basic card layout, I used a negative margin-top property for the profile picture container to achieve the offset design.

## Technologies used

- HTML - Used to create the index.html file
- CSS - Used to design the webpage
- VSCode - IDE I used to create the web app
- Git - For version control
- Netflify - Used to host this web app
